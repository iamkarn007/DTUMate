# Socialmedia
In this project we have tried to make a social media platform for specific group of people i.e. College Students. In this website we have used React.JS Front end Development and Firebase is used as the Backend for the project.

The innovative idea for this project is that we have created it for a specific target audience rather than a general target audience. On this website every user will be anonymous but their identity will be verified before the account is created. The main reason for keeping the user anonymous is because we have seen students struggling to ask questions, talk about things, ask doubts for subject related things and because of this we have decided to keep the identity anonymous. If someone doesnâ€™t know who is asking the doubt then it will be easier for both the parties i.e. person asking and the person answering.

For example during the placement session everyone starts practicing questions and many doubts come up but very few people have someone in their life that they can frankly ask questions to clear doubts and this is where our anonymous social media website comes in. We also have few other things planned for the future of this website like inclusion of a code editor and all.
